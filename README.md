Hello User, this is my React Tutoring App that allows a user to find a tutor catered to designated zip codes in the Los Angeles county!

A live link to my app can be found: https://tutor-app-6fsgcllgt.vercel.app/

Documentation of API: http://localhost:8000/api/tutors

Summary:
The purpose of this application is for the user to be able to find a tutor catered to selected zipcodes provided from the website. The user is then able to see a tutor that would be available depending on the zip code selected. The user is also able to view all of the tutors provided when clicking on the navigation bar and selecting the "Find Tutor" option. The application also provides buttons on the homepage that are designated for the school subject the user is interested in utilizing.

Now the user is able to select from a dropdown of zipcodes and click on the "Submit" button, in which a designated tutor based on the selected zipcode will display on the screen.
